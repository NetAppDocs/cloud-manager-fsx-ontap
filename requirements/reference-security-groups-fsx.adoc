Cloud Manager creates AWS security groups that include the inbound and outbound rules that Cloud Manager and FSx for ONTAP need to operate successfully. You might want to refer to the ports for testing purposes or if you need to use your own.

== Rules for FSx for ONTAP

The FSx for ONTAP security group requires both inbound and outbound rules. This diagram illustrates FSx for ONTAP networking configuration and security group requirements.

.Before you begin
You need to locate the security groups associated with the ENIs using the AWS Management Console.

.Steps
. Open the FSx for ONTAP file system in the AWS Management Console and click the file system ID link.

=== Outbound rules

The predefined security group for FSx for ONTAP opens all outbound traffic. If that is acceptable, follow the basic outbound rules. If you need more rigid rules, use the advanced outbound rules.

==== Basic outbound rules

The predefined security group for FSx for ONTAP includes the following outbound rules.

[cols=3*,options="header",width=70%,cols="20,20,60"]
|===

| Protocol
| Port
| Purpose

| All ICMP |	All |	All outbound traffic
| All TCP |	All |	All outbound traffic
| All UDP |	All |	All outbound traffic

|===

==== Advanced outbound rules

You do not need to open specific ports for the mediator or between nodes in FSx for ONTAP.

NOTE: The source is the interface (IP address) on the FSx for ONTAP system.
